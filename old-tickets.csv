I am a counselor at a methadone clinic in Texas, and I am trying to learn if there is a legal or ethical guideline regarding best practices for detoxing a patient off of methadone because they can no longer afford treatment. For all patients who are unable to pay treatment fees, all attempts are made at helping the patient find employment and receive support from community resources, but occasionally there is no option but the terminate their treatment. I have only been able to find general or vague recommendations from private organizations to detox patients in ""as humane/medically sound of a way as possible"" without any measurable parameters.

He verbally agrees to many things, but then does not agree with the services. He has probation requirements stemming from him assaulting his paramour and making threats to others. He moved out of the apartment with his paramour in part because of probation requirements but he and his paramour are still together and so his probation was revoked and he is back in jail. We are having a meeting, but my opinion is that he should serve out the sentence that would be imposed for his actions, mostly because he is 20 years old and may respond to the fact that what he was told would happen if he didn't follow the rules is now happening. The jail is requesting he be discharged to a group home setting. In the past he has threatened others and made it difficult on other group home members, and had several hospitalizations when he was a teenager when pressed by others. I don't agree that he should be placed in a group home because the contact with the paramour would continue.",(570) 265-1760,Bradford county human services,18848,United States,Other,Social Worker

I wonder if others have seen this happen. Biologically it seems plausible that medical illness that causes weakness decreases resting muscle tone and can unmask TD (like tapping fingers on AIMS unmasks it). This seems important because it means that if we see TD develop rapidly we should be concerned about getting a work up for medical illness if etiology is unknown but I've never heard this talked about and can't find literature on it. I also wonder if low resting muscle tone is part of the reason older women are at higher risk of TD.",(516) 459-3454,Horizon House,19104,United States,Colleague/Word Of Mouth,Other

While I used to believe that the growing frequency of antipsychotic co-pharmacy observed in our patient population was an external problem,  typically inherited from inpatient facilities or unenlightened psychiatrists outside our agency, I've lately become aware that such practices are increasing amongst my staff, even the ECP's who trained in the current era and, otherwise, endorse recovery-oriented practice.   When I ask them why, expecting to hear some version of the ""practice-based evidence"" notion,  what I'm typically told is something to the effect, ""But s/he is so very psychotic"", and, even when I ask if the co-pharmacy has made a difference, that ""S/he is still very psychotic.""    The concept that some people with schizophrenia may have an illness that is treatment refractory--even to clozapine, though increasingly it seems that getting a patient on clozapine has become an endpoint in itself, regardless of lack of benefit--and that, in such situations, ""Do no harm"" should be our guiding principle, seems lost upon them.  Albeit, more recent journal articles (JAMA Psychiatry, February 2019) have opened the door to consideration of combination treatments for resistant illness, e.g., clozapine and aripiprazole, can you refer us to other guidelines or analyses of these practices that would help us keep aggressive attempts to relieve suffering and ""Do no harm"" in balance?",(215) 518-2053,HORIZON HOUSE INC,190104,gf_other_choice,Conference Exhibit,

However, the client considers himself a ""psychiatric survivor"" and more or less denies his diagnosis.   He does not take any medication to treat it and prefers more homeopathic models to treat it.  Because of his reluctance to address the diagnosis, I have thus far been focusing on the behaviors themselves, i.e., regardless of why he behaves as he does, there are certain behaviors that cause issues in the home and the family would like it to change.  Obviously, this is very challenging because if he could simply stop the behavior he would, but he can't because of the diagnosis, but again, he refuses to acknowledge the diagnosis, so we're trapped in this cycle.  I have had some individual sessions with him and I believe I am starting to develop a solid therapeutic rapport with him with the hope that we could eventually address the bipolar and how it impacts him and his family.

Is any information available as to what extent different ages and weights would affect this algorithm?2. In the program, it was noted that Finns had a risk of agranulocytosis almost 20 times that of the rest of the world. If this is correct, do we think that this is related to some genetic factor? I believe Finland had been a relatively isolated area in the past, and there are some different genetic variants there. If there indeed is a Finnish genetic variant predisposing to agranulocytosis, is this being studied, and could this help with identifying who is at risk for agranulocytosis?3. In the program, it was mentioned that Australia has exceptionally high reported rates of myocarditis. Is this accurate? If so, again, is there a genetic factor involved here?

I had a former client call me and reported that he was feeling suicidal. I asked if he had contacted our psychiatric crisis center. He reported that he had and they told him to connect with me. I think crisis response thought the he was still open to my services however, he was closed more than a year ago on good terms. The ct. was not willing to call crisis services again because it seemed hopeless to him. I asked several questions related to suicide plan and intent. I determined that he was an immediate threat to himself. I encouraged him to call 911. He reported he was afraid to do so. I asked if he was willing to meet me outside of his place of residence. He felt relieved by this. When I met him outside of his home he was willing to call 911. Ambulance came and brought him to the Emergency Department. At the ED he was told he did not meet criteria for hospitalization. This prevented him from being hospitalized after three attempts to get help. He was then jailed due to mental health symptoms (paranoia, command hallucinations, ect.). While in jail he tried to kill himself and was then placed in ICU for several days until discharged to psych unit. Is it ethical to support a former client in crisis if I assessed that he was at immediate danger?

Have a client couple, one member is acknowledged bipolar, still investigating exact diagnosis and current medications.

She is smoking marijuana every evening to ""come down"" and is having trouble caring for children at times. Past history of hypersexuality, gambling, spending. I am concerned that the ego-syntonic nature of her manic state (""never felt better"", ""seeing God"") is making it hard for her to recognize the advantages of her current situation.I'm interested in possible lines of couples therapy for stabilizing relationship so that she could join with her partner in an alliance against risky or impulsive behavior should the mania worsen. From narrative therapy, I have a goal of helping the couple externalize and identify the bipolar disorder (or the two phases of mania and depression) as unwelcome outside ""character(s)"" who perhaps have names and agendas that are maladaptive, to be able to take note of when those characters come up and be able to discuss and collaborate on strategies to keep them in check.

One meets criteria for mild schizophrenia which is otherwise managed by low dose Risperdal. The second woman has no history  of a schizophrenia diagnosis.   Both of them report hearing the voice of a single threatening male in their apartment.  Attempt to deal with this voice by increasing meds (in the case of the first women) or initiating low does antipsychotics (in the case of the second woman) have not reduced their experience of voices at all.  In other ways they function well - have a circle of women friends, keep their apartment clean,  In the case of the first woman the voice is that of a known male who lives in the community and makes statements threatening to allow an unidentified black man to enter her apartment and rape her. In the case of the second woman there is no identification to the ""person"" except male and knows when she is in the apartment and makes sounds such as clearing his throat to let her know he is behind the refrigerator when she is in the apartment. In both cases the voices disappear when they are in the company of friends, but turning on the radio at home does not make the voices stop.     I fear that pushing dose of antipsychotics higher is not justified by the potential benefit.  But they both are disgruntled that I can't give them a solution - even while insisting that these voices are real and not a product of their mal functioning brain.

She has been on clozapine 500mg at night long-term. Due to an increase in symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) I recently raised the dose by 50mg. This was helpful but symptoms persisted, so we then increased by another 50mg and I had her do a clozapine level just to see where she was at. It came back extremely high (1818, serum clozapine range 350-650). She denies any side effect concerns and says voices are almost gone with the increase. However I'm concerned about toxicity so lowered the dose by 50mg and had her re-check level a few days later, making sure she did not take the clozapine for 12 hours prior to lab. I just got the results back and it's now 2100. Another concern is that her monthly white blood cell count was 13.7 recently and her A1c was 7.7 (she does not have a prior history of diabetes). I'm prioritizing getting her set up with a PCP for the diabetes and high WBC as she does not have one. In the meantime my thought is to lower the clozapine by 50mg and recheck level in about a week. She is concerned about this however as she finds it helpful and I don't want her to decompensate psychiatrically. I'm not very familiar with checking troponin levels or CRP but wondering if this or other testing may be recommended?

She does this to this degree at home and patient has begun falling at home.When I saw her in person, it seemed more gross movement than I see with TD but reading further and looking at videos, perhaps this is TD. I am doing the usual- starting with weaning the Risperdal. I will then use Amantadine, then Austedo then Ingrezza. ( This is the order the pharmacy contract insists that we use. )Two questions 1) when  should a neurologist be involved and images of the brain sought? I did a bit of reading and can see that the Ddx includes TD but other conditions as well. Neurologist appointments for our safety net patients are 3 months out.  Do you have any therapeutic advice for these severe symptoms?Thanks Stephanie Brown, MD",(530) 666-8630,Yolo County MH,95695,United States,Print Ad in a Journal,Psychiatrist

And what dose of Haldol would you initially target? I went for 10mg Haldol but wondering if that was too aggressive. He has no signs of EPS but is very flat with a lot of negative symptoms.Second question is — how quickly would you consider clozapine in this patient?

He lives with supportive parents and despite their efforts med adherence is very questionable though he declines to discuss side effects or other med concerns.

He just got out of a month long hospitalization and remains very ill (predominantly psychotic but with some hypomania). He has failed numerous antipsychotic trials, including the high dose risperidone and olanzapine he was discharged on. He was tried on clozapine inpatient, but his platelets dropped (lowest was 91, with range of 150-450 representing normal) so they stopped it. He was also on Depakote at that time, but inpatient noted that his platelets recovered with just stopping clozapine.  I think it is necessary to give clozapine a full trial given the severity of his illness and lack of response to other antipsychotics.  Ideally, he’d see a hematologist as we retry it, but he is refusing to see the hematologist.

However, she poorly tolerates oral contraceptives and is only using condoms as birth control at this point. I don't feel comfortable prescribing Depakote in that setting. What method of birth control would be acceptable in order to prescribe Depakote? Obviously a tubal ligation or a vasectomy would be ideal but that's not going to happen in the near future.

She’s still somewhat hypomanic, went back to work.  A lot of borderline traits, but hard to tell in the context of recent mania.  I don’t have Depakene levels although requested. She went to see PCP had some blood in her urine ( I don’t believe it’s related) and high red cell count, which I don’t think is associated with depakene  ( macrocytosis yes).  She’s refused lithium.  Weight gain likely also related to olanzapine.  I don’t want to initiate lamictal until she’s more stable.  She did well on lithium but won’t try again.  Any recommendations?

Thank you so much for your help! I had two questions about recommended practice guidelines regarding lithium:1) I have a patient on lithium who would like to start spironolactone. From a review of spironolactone prescribing instructions, ""Like other diuretics, ALDACTONE reduces the renal clearance of lithium, thus increasing the risk of lithium toxicity. Monitor lithium levels periodically when ALDACTONE is coadministered."" Is there an evidence-based way to approach this? Are people recommended to preventatively lower the lithium dose by 25-50% when starting spironolactone or just keep the dose as it is and check a level? How soon after starting spironolactone would it make sense to check a lithium level? I searched pubmed but I could not find any research in people, although I saw one animal study which showed no change in lithium level when spironolactone was given. 2. When cross-tapering lithium to depakote, is there an evidence-based way to do this safely? For example, would it be helpful to have a 2-week overlap period of full dose lithium and depakote prior to tapering lithium? Or would a longer period be helpful?

Our specialized residential programs serve many individuals with severely refractory Schizophrenia, who are referred as they transition ""back to society"" from long term stays in correctional or state hospital settings, having committed violent acts. It is not always clinically feasible to streamline the psychotropic regimen they come to us on. Even with monotherapy, most of these individuals are found to have varying degrees of hyperprolactinemia.My experience is that psychiatrists don't tend to monitor prolactin levels unless there is a complaint of gynecomastia or galactorrhea. My recent perusal of the literature indicates that even asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia can cause long term risks including osteoporosis, breast and prostate cancer, insulin resistance, etc. As such, I feel that we should be monitoring prolactin levels periodically, but my staff is now rather up in arms as to how to manage the large number of folks with even minor elevations. We are aware of strategies such as decreasing dose, augmenting with Abilify or using other pro-dopiminergic agents. Without overly burdening the already thinly available level of primary medical care, is there a guideline as to when we treat and when we refer patients for further assessment?

I'm not aware of any poor metabolizers of CYP1A2, 3A4 but perhaps you have?

This seems to last for about a week. Then, during the next 7-10 days, he reports that it works well for him, and not to change it.  Then during the last 7-10 days, it seems to have completely stopped working, where he becomes agitated, saying he's not going to take it, and doesn't need it.  We have frequently had to issue AOT pickup orders and send him to the ER to get the injection.  Then the pattern resumes.I have 2 questions:1.  Do you think I could give him a lower dose more frequently, such has 150mg every 2-3 weeks, or does that not make sense due to the half life of haldol?2.  Any other suggestion about how I can manage this?Thanks.Carolyn Flaherty",(631) 669-8377,Family Service League,11795,gf_other_choice,Internet Search,Other

During psychotic episodes he responds to internal stimuli, experiences upsetting AH, becomes disorganized and aggressive. He has had four psychiatric hospitalizations. In 2021 he improved on Olanzapine 10 mg but was not consistent so he was switched to Abilify Maintena 400 mg IM q 4 weeks in March 2022. He did better on it initially but then started experiencing significant psychosis requiring hospitalization; he was very aggressive requiring a 1:1 at the hospital. He was loaded on Invega injection (256 mg IM maintenance dose and Olanzapine 10 mg twice daily). The plan was to taper Olanzapine off after he had a few months of stability. He reports not using cannabis or tobacco though his mom suspects that he is smoking cigarettes. He continues to experience voices every two days, panic attacks and depressive symptoms.  He spends most of his time in his room, does not take care of hygiene and is again becoming more hostile toward his mother. He has gained 50 lbs on this regimen and his BMI is now 36 (he declines Metformin and to check labs). Sertraline 200 mg has not helped with anxiety or depressive symptoms. He declines bloodwork so Clozapine is not a good option. Was curious about which antipsychotic would be reasonably to switch Olanzapine to?

I have a 12 year old pt with hx of ODD, conduct disorder, and adhd who initially presented to psychiatry around age 5 for severe emotional dysregulation with family hx s/f bipolar in an aunt (conserved at state hospital) and paternal cousin. He's trialed &gt;10 medications (3 mood stabilizer, 3 antipsychotics, stimulants, non-stimulant adhd meds, ssri) and the only med that's ever been helpful for decreasing intensity of (often violent) outbursts is depakote, which he was trialed on at age 7 but subsequently developed neutropenia (now resolved off this medication). He's currently presenting with intermittent hypomanic sx (3-5 hours of sleep, PMA, increased GDA, is hyperverbal, and some increase in GDA) and these sx last around 3 days then he ""crashes"" and sleeps ~15 hrs/day for about 5 days and is now back to the hypomanic sx. He's unable to attend school due to the severity of his symptoms (suspended numerous x this year and parents pulled him out of a non-public school when he became increasingly angry about having to go). I'd like to re-trial depakote but can't find much literature around re-challenging in setting of historic neutropenia or recs for monitoring in this setting.

She states that the last thing she remembers was having 1-2 shots of Monaco liquor and woke up in a jail cell with different pants on. She was charged with OWI because per the police report she was found in a parked running vehicle. When she was taken to the jail cell, she was found not to have pants on, so different pants were given to her but she does not remember any of this. Her ETOH level was 0.27 at 0036 (she reports remembering starting her drinks at 2100) on a data master breath test done at the time of her arrest. Upon being released from jail, she found abrasions on her thighs near her vaginal area and since she suspected being given a rape drug, she went to the hospital to have a rape kit done.  She is now fighting these OWI charges and it is unfortunate that she wasn't initially taken to the hospital where a rape kit could have been done as well as testing for the date rape drugs. But since we don't have this information, I was wondering if an alcohol level of 0.27 alone could result in that degree of memory impairment (she does not recall anything after the 2 drinks...she said that the friend she was with told her she dropped him off at work, and then she was found after that alone in her car)?

I had been prescribing 500 mg po QHS, and he has remained highly symptomatic, so 3 weeks ago I checked a level and it was 146 with a norclozapine level of 154. My impression is that this represents a metabolic ratio of 0.94 most likely representing CYP1A2 induction (most likely because he smokes frequently - amount is uncertain, but at least a few cigars a day) as well as possible non adherence. Mom assures me she is watching patient take his medicine daily, so at that time I increased the dose to 600 mg po daily and re-checked a level a week ago - this has come back with a level &lt;100. Mom continues to insist that she watches him take clozapine daily, but now guesses that it might be possible that he is cheeking medication and throwing it away.For now I have changed the clozapine to fazaclo and asked mom to watch him for a longer amount of time and verify that the pill is fully gone after she gives it to him. I also reduced the total dose to 400 mg daily as I&#039;m not quite sure how to estimate how much he might or might not be getting routinely.Am I correct in assuming that the best explanation for the reduced level despite the increased dose is non adherence?

I understand that you cannot comment explicitly on a specific patient, but I am concerned about a clozapine level and wanted any direction please! Early 60s F with schizophrenia on clozapine 800mg daily (100mg qam, 700mg qhs), abilify 20mg, wellbutrin XL 450, ambien 5mg. Clozapine was increased a few months ago from long term dose of 600mg total due to breakthrough psychosis. She tolerates clozapine very well, no adverse effects at any dose. Breakthrough symptoms appeared to largely resolve with increase of abilify. While on clozapine 600mg daily, clozapine level was 867, norclozapine 402. Now, on 800mg of clozapine daily clozapine level is 1527 and norclozipine is 952. She does get ECT q2 weeks and has not had any unexpected seizures. I understand the levels are very high, but she is tolerating the medication well. Thus, should I decrease back to 600mg to reduce level simply because of high blood levels with 800mg? My understanding of the utility of clozapine levels is they are somewhat correlated to efficacy but largely correlated to side effects (arrythymia, seizure, toxicity). Thus, if she is not having any of those side effects is it warranted to still lower the dose??? THANK YOU!!!

He recently complained to my supervisor that I shouldn't be asking him to consider getting off the valium, and asked to see another provider. My supervisor advised that all the providers practice in a similar fashion.  He reported that it makes him feel anxious when I do so.   We had a conference with the patient, which included my supervisor.  And he appeared manic - very pressured speech, paranoia, not letting us get a word in, which I have not seen in the past.I have 2 questions:1)  could lowering the valium have caused the emergence of mania?2)  If it is bipolar d/o, do you have a suggestion for an appropriate mood stabilizer to put him on, and would you also taper him off the Effexor?ThanksCarolyn Flaherty",(631) 669-8377,Family Service League,11795,United States,Social Media,Other

His reasoning I believe was if the LAI doesn't hold them for the month or 2 months , they will have the Lybalvi on board. I'm not comfortable prescribing 2 second generation anti-psychotics.

It certainly seems like treating his psychosis would take precedent over TD.2) If you did transition to haldol dec, what dose would you start him at?3) One of the Psychiatrists I know refuses to use any FGA in younger patients despite treatment failures. Is there any scenario where the TD was significant enough that you would resort to a SGA LAI that had a less propensity for TD but knowing that he would remain symptomatic?Thanks,Peter",(715) 529-2674,Wellpath,94591,gf_other_choice,Other,Physician Assistant

He is very impaired by his symptoms; we are considering residential placement if his functioning does not improve.What should be the next step?--- ECT not an option at this time.-- do I augment the clozapine with a first-generation antipsychotic like molindone?-- do I switch to a LAI like Invega Sustenna?

My understanding is that you want a drug to reach steady state (at least) before considering changing the dose. So that means for long acting injectable medications, you typically would need to wait months at a time before considering changing the dose. For instance, abilify maintena reaches steady state after the 4th injection. Does that mean we actually have to wait four months before determining if abilify maintena is efficacious for a patient? Ideally, we would determine efficacy with the oral formulation before converting to maintena, but the reality is that patients are placed on LAIs way before efficacy is established.

He was not physically aggressive. He resists medication and is not consistently compliant. There is a history of multiple medications, most recently divalproex 500mg divalproex 5 tablets q day and olanzapine 15mg on which he was reasonably stable. He consulted a neurologist who diagnosed complex partial seizures from a 3 day video EEG that showed ""episodes of frontal lobe sharp activity and overall posterior pattern slowing. No seizures captured."" The neurologist told him that anti psychotics and marijuana lower his seizure threshhold and that he should not take either.
